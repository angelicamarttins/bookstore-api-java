## Description

  This project is a bookstore API which aims to organize easily your books by categorizing them.

  Initially, the purpose to build it was for studying and implement an API with Java, Spring Boot
  and Spring MVC using Postgres as database and JUnit for tests.

  In the future, my intent is to deploy and distribute a fullstack application freely to public
  schools in SÃ£o Paulo. As a former teacher, I saw school libraries closed with a lot of books
  available, but never used by students because wasn't any free and easy software in school to
  organize and lend books.
